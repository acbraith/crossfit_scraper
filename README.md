This is a basic web scraper for the 2017 Crossfit leaderboards.

Use get_analysis_dataframe(...) to get a Pandas DataFrame full of benchmarks and workout results for any analysis you want. 
Make sure there's a /cache folder in the same directory as crossfit_scaper.py; big queries will be stored here (including the full leaderboards you get, manually delete the files if you want to refresh your data).
